<br/><br/>The Clean Energy Regulator is the Government body responsible for administering legislation that will reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of clean energy.

<br/><br/>The Clean Energy Regulator was established on 2 April 2012 as an independent statutory authority by the [Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2011A00163) and operates as part of the [Environment portfolio](http://www.environment.gov.au/). The role of the Clean Energy Regulator is determined by climate change law. The schemes administered by CER work together to reduce emissions while encouraging business competiveness.

<br/><br/>CER’s purpose is to accelerate carbon abatement for Australia. Everything CER does is connected to measuring, managing, reducing or offsetting Australia’s carbon emissions.
