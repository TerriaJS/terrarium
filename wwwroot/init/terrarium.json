The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:<p><a href='https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/'>https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/</a><p>The aremi-tmy tool will be used to generate Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data. As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>The SSHO data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed.
