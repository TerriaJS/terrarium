This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.</p><p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done. <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong> Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels.</p><p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (&gt;$400/kVA/yr).</p><p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required.</p><p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics. This was performed using the Danish Technical University (DTU) Generalized Wind Climate software package.

The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"},{"name":"Updates","content":"No updates to the initial project data are available at this stage."},{"name":"Custodian","content":"Institute of Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) worked in collaboration with The Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, University of New South Wales (UNSW) and The Australian Solar Thermal Energy Association (AUSTELA).

To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event.

This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"},{"name":"Updates","content":"No updates to the initial project data are available at this stage."},{"name":"Custodian","content":"Institute of Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) worked in collaboration with The Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, University of New South Wales (UNSW) and The Australian Solar Thermal Energy Association (AUSTELA).

Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO.

As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>After the One Minute Solar data has been processed into the SSHO timeseries, further processing takes place to analyse the separate months of timeseries data to determine the &quot;most typical&quot; months. This analysis is based on the Sandia Method as detailed by S. Wilcox and W. Marion in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf'>'Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets', NREL</a>.<p>In order to generate a TMY for a station it is a requirement that at least one of the calendar months has data from at least 9 different years.<p>The TMY data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data."},{"name":"Source Data","content":"The Bureau One Minute Solar data includes a range of solar statistics, including global, diffuse, direct and terrestrial irradiance and sunshine-seconds.<p>One Minute Solar data is not based on a real-time product. Data is processed by the Bureau of Meteorology nominally at one to two monthly intervals.<p>The Bureau of Meteorology has been measuring a range of solar parameters for several decades. The development of a new high quality observation system, which first became operational in 1993, has facilitated the measurement of one minute solar statistics.
