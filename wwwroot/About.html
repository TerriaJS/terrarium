      <section class="information">

        <p>Terrarium is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data relevant to the Renewable Energy industry - with a focus on Developers, Financiers, and Policy Makers. It is funded by the <a href="http://arena.gov.au/">Australian Renewable Energy Agency</a> and developed by <a href="http://www.nicta.com.au/">NICTA</a> in partnership with the <a href="https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/">Clean Energy Council</a> with hosting being provided by <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">Geoscience Australia</a>. This website is an extension of the Australian Government's <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/">National Map</a> initiative.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Terrarium</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically
        accessing the data directly from the government department or agency which is the custodian of that data.</p>

        <p><strong>Terrarium</strong>...</p>
        <ul>
           <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
           <li>facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
           <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To see what data is available on Terrarium, refer to the Data Catalogue in the
        <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/">Terrarium</a> itself. Click the <b>Data Catalogue</b> tab and expand the Data Set group names.</p>
